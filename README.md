# Tic-Tac-Toe
FONTS FROM GOOGLE

This project was built in order to help my understanding with 
module patterns/IIFE and use of factory functions. Some issues
that I had with this project were figuring how to implement an algorithm
to determine the winner/tie, and trying to my best to make the code as clean
as possible. Some features that I will be adding in the near future is a play again button, and an option to play against AI.

ENJOY!
